- This repository includes my notes about Clean Code by Robert C. Martin.
- I couldn't change most of the sentences, when taking notes. My aim is to provide guideline for developers who don't have to time read a book(or don't like to read book) 
- I couldn't added chapters 14(Successive Refinement),15(JUnit Internals), and 16(Refactoring SerialDate). That's why last chapter Smells and Heuristics (actually chapter 17 in the book) seems like chapter 14 in my notes.
- I also added PDF version of my notes. You can download it from my git repo.
